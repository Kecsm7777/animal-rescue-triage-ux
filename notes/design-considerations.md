# Design Considerations

## Ethical responsibility
Triage systems must not shift moral responsibility from human operators to automated logic. This project treats accountability as a first-class UX constraint.

## Uncertainty handling
Information at intake is often incomplete, contradictory, or emotionally charged. The system is designed to surface uncertainty rather than resolve it prematurely.

## Automation bias
Decision-support signals are intentionally bounded to avoid encouraging over-reliance or false objectivity in urgent situations.

## Scope limits
The system does not make final rescue decisions. It supports prioritization, documentation, and situational awareness for trained staff and volunteers.
