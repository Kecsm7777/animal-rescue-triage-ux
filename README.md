# Animal Rescue Triage System

A UX and systems design case study focused on how decision-support tools can assist animal welfare intake and triage while preserving human judgment, ethical responsibility, and uncertainty awareness.

## Overview
Animal rescue intake involves incomplete information, emotional urgency, and ethical tradeoffs. Automated or semi-automated triage systems risk oversimplifying complex situations or shifting responsibility away from human decision-makers.

This project examines how triage logic, prioritization signals, and system boundaries can be designed to support humane, defensible decisions without collapsing uncertainty into false precision.

## UX Focus
- Designing triage systems that support, rather than replace, human judgment
- Making uncertainty and incomplete evidence explicit
- Preventing automation bias in urgent decision contexts
- Preserving ethical accountability in system-assisted workflows

## Artifacts
Selected screenshots and diagrams are included in:
- `screenshots/` (representative system views and decision logic examples)

## Notes
This repository focuses on system behavior, decision framing, and ethical constraints rather than interface styling or operational deployment.
